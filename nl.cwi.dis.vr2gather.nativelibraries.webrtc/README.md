# VR2Gather native libraries

This package contains a number of native plugins (DLL's, dylib's, so's) for various platforms that enable some functionality in VR2Gather (`nl.cwi.dis.vr2gather`).

These libraries are hardly useful on their own.

Some of the native plugins here are not open source, but their license permits redistribution in binary form.

This package is part of VR2Gather, <https://github.com/cwi-dis/VR2Gather>.
